# Plant Disease Classifier

## Overview

The Plant Disease Classifier is a web application powered by FastAPI and TensorFlow, designed to assist in the detection of plant diseases through image analysis. Users can upload images of their plants, and the application utilizes a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict the health status of the plant, providing predictions with confidence levels.
